## Hi there 👋
I'm **Ran Alicia Jing from Beijing**, China. My Chinese name is **Ran Jing (景然)**. I'm a sophomore student in Beijing Forestry University （北京林业大学）, currently major in Biomass material and energy. In undergraduate stage, I'll be doing some research on biomass hydrogel. However, given that I've been passionate about astronomy and astrophysics since I was littel, I hope I can study astrophysics in my post-graduate stage, which is a goal I've been making effort from now. (e.g. I've accomplished a research project in the light of Elite Program under the supervision of Ke Wang & Fengwei Xu at **KIAA-PKU**, etc.)
