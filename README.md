## Hi there 👋
I'm **Ran Alicia Jing** from Beijing, China. My Chinese name is **Ran Jing (景然)**. Born in 2006, ♂️. Sophomore student in Beijing Forestry University （北京林业大学）, currently major in Biomass material and energy. In undergraduate stage, I'll be doing some research on **biomass hydrogel**. However, given that I've been passionate about astronomy and astrophysics since I was littel, I hope I can study astrophysics in my post-graduate stage, which is a goal I've been making effort from now. (e.g. I've accomplished a research project in the light of Elite Program under the supervision of Ke Wang & Fengwei Xu at **KIAA-PKU**, etc.)

Here's some more concrete information about me! ☀️
### Research Interest
1. 🌱 As a undergraduate student who major in Biomass material and energy, I'm and I'll probably be doing research related to biomass hydrogel or bio-pulping under the supervision of teachers in our college. Recently I'm doing some literature retrieving work on biomass hydrogel in a research team which include tutors from either BFU or THU, covering students from my major and those major in artificial intelligence. In the following period, I'll also participate in experimental hands-on and data analysis.
2. ✨ I'm really into astrophysics. To be more detailed, **star formation, weak gravitational lensing, interstellar medium (ISM), galactic structure and evolution, binary stars, AGNs**, ect. TBC
3. 🖥️ What's more, machine learning and LLM also attract me to some extent. I guess that would be the work of our teacher of the course _An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence_

### Academic Experiences
- Accomplished an astronomical project (**Analyzing the distribution distinction between dust and gas in the Galactic disk using multiband data from Planck**) in light of the Elite Program under the supervision of Prof. Ke Wang and Dr. Fengwei Xu at KIAA-PKU in Jun. - Nov. 2022
- As the host, I completed an astronomical project (**Optimizing detection of low SNR via weak gravitational lensing corrections in cosmic large scale structure**) with the guidance of Prof. Shuo Cao in Jun. 2025
- I participated the bubbles catcher project based on the 3D dust extinction map led by Prof Haibo Yuan and Dr. Tao Wang at Beijing Normal University in Sep. 2025 and did a lot of work for the identification and classification of stellar-driven bubbles.

### Scientific Skills
- Python for data reduction and analysis (intermediate or advanced, especially Astropy, NumPy and Matplotlib, mostly used currently), C++ for backend developing (beginner)
- CARTA, XCLASS, TOPCAT, SAOds9 (starter or intermediate)
- Paper writing with LaTeX (overleaf and texstudio), note taking with Markdown or LaTeX, and slides making with LibreOffice, LaTeX beamer, Micorsoft Office
- Skilled in searching papers using Google Scholar, NASA/ADS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, etc.
- TBC

### In case you wanna know more~💖
Love 🏐**VOLLEYBALL**! (I serve as the first libero in my school team); 

Love **CODING!** You wouldn't know how excited I'm gonna be when I open my Jupyter Notebook! 

Love **Karaoke**! Sing those favorite songs is always relishing; 

Love **Electronic music**! (especially Tropical House, Hardcore, Complectro, Psychedelic electro, etc. I probably fancy colorful music).
